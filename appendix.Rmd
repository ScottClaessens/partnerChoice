### Calculating linguistic distances between nations

Linguistic distance between two countries was calculated as the cultural proximity between all languages spoken within those countries, weighted by speaker percentages. We acquired cultural proximity data by combining the language family trees provided by Glottolog v3.0 (Hammarstr√∂m et al., 2017) into one global language tree (undated and unresolved). We calculated cultural proximity $s$ between two languages $j$ and $k$ as the distance (in number of nodes traversed) of their most recent common ancestor $i$ to the root of the tree, through the formula:

$$
s_{jk} = \frac{n_{r}-n_{i}}{n_{r}}
$$

where $n_{r}$ is the maximum path length (in number of nodes traversed) leading to the pan-human root $r$, and $n_{i}$ is the maximum path length leading to node $i$. We then combined these proximities with speaker data from Ethnologue 21 (Eberhard et al., 2018) and compared every language spoken within those countries by at least 1 permille of the population, weighted by speaker percentages, through the formula:

$$
w_{lm} = {\Sigma}{\Sigma}p_{lj}p_{mk}s_{jk}
$$

where $p_{lj}$ is the percentage of the population in nation $l$ speaking language $j$, $p_{mk}$ is the percentage of the population in nation $m$ speaking language $k$, and $s_{jk}$ is the proximity measure between languages $j$ and $k$ (Eff, 2008).

### Bayesian multilevel models

In both Studies 1 and 2, we use Bayesian multilevel models to test our hypotheses. Below, we write out the formulae for the different models. We focus on models that include relational mobility as the only predictor, but these can be generalised to include additional predictors as fixed effects.

In Study 1, we model prosociality as the outcome variable ($\text{Pro}$), relational mobility as the country-level predictor variable ($\text{Rel}$), random intercepts and slopes for different prosociality items in the Global Preferences Survey ($\text{item}$; altruism, positive reciprocity, and trust), and random intercepts for participants ($\text{part}$) and countries ($\text{country}$).

To deal with spatial and cultural non-independence between countries, we allow separate random intercepts for countries to covary according to geographic ($\textbf{G}$) and linguistic ($\textbf{L}$) proximity matrices. This is similar to the approach employed in phylogenetic general linear mixed models, which deal with the non-independent structure in model 'residuals' by including a pre-computed covariance matrix specifying the relationships between species (Villemereuil & Nakagawa, 2014; see also [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/vignettes/brms_phylogenetics.html)). In addition to these random effects, we include a residual random intercept over countries to capture country-specific effects that are independent of geographic and linguistic relationships with other countries.

We also model relational mobility with measurement error by including standard deviations ($\text{Rel}_{\text{SD}}$) from observed latent variable means ($\text{Rel}_{\text{OBS}}$). This ensures that the uncertainty in the measurement of relational mobility from previous research is propagated into this model.

The model formula is as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Pro}_{i} &\sim \text{Normal}(\mu_{i},\sigma) \\
\mu_{i} &= \alpha_{i} + \beta_{i}\text{Rel}_{\text{TRUE},i} \\
\text{Rel}_{\text{TRUE},i} &= \lambda + \kappa z_{\text{country}[i]} \\
\text{Rel}_{\text{OBS},i} &\sim \text{Normal}(\text{Rel}_{\text{TRUE},i}, \text{Rel}_{\text{SD},i}) \\
\alpha_{i} &= \bar{\alpha} + \alpha_{\text{item}[i]} + \alpha_{\text{part}[i]} + \alpha_{\text{G,country}[i]} + \alpha_{\text{L,country}[i]} + \alpha_{\text{R,country}[i]} \\
\beta_{i} &= \bar{\beta} + \beta_{\text{item}[i]} \\
\begin{bmatrix}\alpha_{\text{item}}\\
\beta_{\text{item}}\end{bmatrix} &\sim \text{MVNormal}
\begin{pmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\end{bmatrix},\textbf{S}
\end{pmatrix}\\
\textbf{S} &=
\begin{pmatrix}\tau_{\alpha}&0\\0&\tau_{\beta}\end{pmatrix}
\textbf{R}
\begin{pmatrix}\tau_{\alpha}&0\\0&\tau_{\beta}\end{pmatrix} \\
\alpha_{\text{part}} &\sim \text{Normal}(0, \tau_{P}) \\
\alpha_{\text{G,country}} &\sim \text{Normal}(0, \tau_{G} \textbf{G}) \\
\alpha_{\text{L,country}} &\sim \text{Normal}(0, \tau_{L} \textbf{L}) \\
\alpha_{\text{R,country}} &\sim \text{Normal}(0, \tau_{R}) \\
z_{\text{country}} &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 1)\\
\bar{\alpha},\bar{\beta},\lambda &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 0.1) \\
\textbf{R} &\sim \text{LKJCorr}(1)\\
\kappa,\tau_{\alpha},\tau_{\beta},\tau_{P},\tau_{G},\tau_{L},\tau_{R},\sigma &\sim \text{Exponential}(5)
\end{aligned}
$$
where $\bar{\alpha}$ and $\bar{\beta}$ represent intercept and slope fixed effects, other $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters represent random intercepts and slopes, $\tau$ parameters represent standard deviations for random effects, $\textbf{R}$ represents the correlation matrix for the item random effects, $\sigma$ represents the residual variance, and $\lambda$, $\kappa$, and $z$ represent the mean, standard deviation, and standardised latent values for the relational mobility measurement error model.

As a formula suitable for the R package _brms_, the model is written as follows:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
brm(
  formula = Pro ~ 0 + Intercept + me(RML, RML_SE, gr = iso) + 
    (1 + RML | item) + (1 | id) + (1 | gr(iso1, cov = lingCov)) + 
    (1 | gr(iso2, cov = geoCov)) + (1 | iso3), 
  data = d, 
  family = gaussian,
  prior = c(prior(normal(0, 0.1), class = b),
            prior(exponential(5), class = sd),
            prior(exponential(5), class = sigma),
            prior(normal(0, 0.1), class = meanme),
            prior(exponential(5), class = sdme)), 
  data2 = list(lingCov = lingCov, geoCov = geoCov)
  )
```

\newpage

In Study 2, we use two types of Bayesian multilevel model. To analyse binary data on charitable organisation membership ($\text{Org}$) and generalised trust ($\text{GenTru}$), we use multilevel logistic regression models with random intercepts for countries. As in Study 1, we allow country random intercepts to vary according to geographic and linguistic proximity, and we model measurement error on the relational mobility predictor.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Org}_{i}/\text{GenTru}_{i} &\sim \text{Bernoulli}(p_{i}) \\
\text{logit}(p_{i}) &= \alpha_{i} + \beta\text{Rel}_{\text{TRUE},i} \\
\text{Rel}_{\text{TRUE},i} &= \lambda + \kappa z_{\text{country}[i]} \\
\text{Rel}_{\text{OBS},i} &\sim \text{Normal}(\text{Rel}_{\text{TRUE},i}, \text{Rel}_{\text{SD},i}) \\
\alpha_{i} &= \bar{\alpha} + \alpha_{\text{G,country}[i]} + \alpha_{\text{L,country}[i]} + \alpha_{\text{R,country}[i]} \\
\alpha_{\text{G,country}} &\sim \text{Normal}(0, \tau_{G} \textbf{G}) \\
\alpha_{\text{L,country}} &\sim \text{Normal}(0, \tau_{L} \textbf{L}) \\
\alpha_{\text{R,country}} &\sim \text{Normal}(0, \tau_{R}) \\
\lambda &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 0.1) \\
\kappa &\sim \text{Exponential}(5) \\
\bar{\alpha},\beta,z_{\text{country}} &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 1)\\
\tau_{G},\tau_{L},\tau_{R} &\sim \text{Exponential}(2)
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\bar{\alpha}$ and $\beta$ represent the intercept and slope fixed effects, other $\alpha$ parameters represent random intercepts, $\tau$ parameters represent standard deviations for random effects, and $\lambda$, $\kappa$, and $z$ represent the mean, standard deviation, and standardised latent values for the relational mobility measurement error model.

In _brms_, this model is written as follows:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
brm(
  formula = Org ~ 0 + Intercept + me(RML, RML_SE, gr = iso) + 
    (1 | gr(iso1, cov = lingCov)) + (1 | gr(iso2, cov = geoCov)) + 
    (1 | iso3), 
  data = d, family = bernoulli,
  prior = c(prior(normal(0, 1), class = b),
            prior(exponential(2), class = sd),
            prior(normal(0, 0.1), class = meanme),
            prior(exponential(5), class = sdme)),
  data2 = list(lingCov = lingCov, geoCov = geoCov)
  )
```

To analyse ordinal data on trust in different groups ($\text{Trust}$) and moral justifiability of different antisocial behaviours ($\text{Just}$), we use multilevel cumulative link regression models with random intercepts and slopes for groups / behaviours ($\text{item}$), as well as random intercepts for participants and countries. Again, as in Study 1, we allow country random intercepts to vary according to geographic and linguistic proximity, and we model measurement error on the relational mobility predictor.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Trust}_{i}/\text{Just}_{i} &\sim \text{Ordered-logit}(\phi_{i},\zeta) \\
\phi_{i} &= \alpha_{i} + \beta_{i}\text{Rel}_{\text{TRUE},i} \\
\text{Rel}_{\text{TRUE},i} &= \lambda + \kappa z_{\text{country}[i]} \\
\text{Rel}_{\text{OBS},i} &\sim \text{Normal}(\text{Rel}_{\text{TRUE},i}, \text{Rel}_{\text{SD},i}) \\
\alpha_{i} &= \alpha_{\text{item}[i]} + \alpha_{\text{part}[i]} + \alpha_{\text{G,country}[i]} + \alpha_{\text{L,country}[i]} + \alpha_{\text{R,country}[i]} \\
\beta_{i} &= \bar{\beta} + \beta_{\text{item}[i]} \\
\begin{bmatrix}\alpha_{\text{item}}\\
\beta_{\text{item}}\end{bmatrix} &\sim \text{MVNormal}
\begin{pmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\end{bmatrix}, \textbf{S}
\end{pmatrix}\\
\textbf{S} &=
\begin{pmatrix}\tau_{\alpha}&0\\0&\tau_{\beta}\end{pmatrix}
\textbf{R}
\begin{pmatrix}\tau_{\alpha}&0\\0&\tau_{\beta}\end{pmatrix} \\
\alpha_{\text{part}} &\sim \text{Normal}(0, \tau_{P}) \\
\alpha_{\text{G,country}} &\sim \text{Normal}(0, \tau_{G} \textbf{G}) \\
\alpha_{\text{L,country}} &\sim \text{Normal}(0, \tau_{L} \textbf{L}) \\
\alpha_{\text{R,country}} &\sim \text{Normal}(0, \tau_{R}) \\
z_{\text{country}} &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 1)\\
\zeta_{j} &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 2)\\
\bar{\beta} &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 0.5) \\
\lambda &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 0.1) \\
\kappa &\sim \text{Exponential}(5) \\
\textbf{R} &\sim \text{LKJCorr}(1)\\
\tau_{\alpha},\tau_{\beta},\tau_{P},\tau_{G},\tau_{L},\tau_{R} &\sim \text{Exponential}(4) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\zeta$ parameters represent ordinal intercept cutpoints, $\bar{\beta}$ represents the slope fixed effect, other $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters represent random intercepts and slopes, $\tau$ parameters represent standard deviations for random effects, $\textbf{R}$ represents the correlation matrix for the item random effects, and $\lambda$, $\kappa$, and $z$ represent the mean, standard deviation, and standardised latent values for the relational mobility measurement error model.
